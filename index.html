        Every budding hacker needs an alias! The Phantom Phreak, Acid Burn, Zero Cool and Crash Override are some notable examples from the <br>
        film Hackers.<br>
        <br>
        Your task is to create a function that, given a proper first and last name, will return the correct alias.<br>
        <br>
        Notes:<br>
        Two objects that return a one word name in response to the first letter of the first name and one for the first letter of the surname <br>
        are already given. See the examples below for further details.<br>
        <br>
        If the first character of either of the names given to the function is not a letter from A - Z, you should return "Your name must <br>
        start with a letter from A - Z."<br>
        <br>
        Sometimes people might forget to capitalize the first letter of their name so your function should accommodate for these grammatical <br>
        errors.<br>
